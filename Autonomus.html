                                Autonomous driving has received a unified definition by the automotive industry and can
                                be best described as “the capability of a car to drive partly or fully by itself, with
                                limited or no human intervention.” According to the Society of Automotive Engineers
                                (SAE), taxonomy of vehicle driving automation systems, conditional and high automations
                                are registered in SAE level 3 and SAE level 4 vehicle categories, respectively. Vehicle
                                category SAE level 5 describes fully automated vehicles with driving systems being able
                                to perform the full range of driving functions and modes previously performed by a human
                                driver including steering, acceleration/deceleration, monitoring of the driving
                                environment, and assuming control of all aspects of driving.
                                expected to improve road safety, traffic flow, personal mobility, eco driving, and
                                driver productivity. The variety of driving automation technology in supporting the
                                human driver can be classified toward their level of autonomy (LoA). Each LoA defines
                                the degree to which a vehicle can take over the operation of the dynamic driving task.
                                Based on the international literature, a few taxonomies have been introduced to define
                                distinct degrees of vehicle automation. Out of these, the taxonomy approach developed by
                                SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers), which is outlined in, represents the most recent
                                and comprehensive one where six different levels of vehicle automation about on-road car
                                passenger vehicles are classified. The above levels of increased autonomy differ by the
                                operation of the longitudinal/lateral control and the monitoring of the environment,
                                which can be either controlled by the driver or the on-board driving automation system.

                            <h3>Safety:</h3>
                            <p>
                                Monitoring of the driving environment in order to identify potential problems and
                                emergency situations and automatically take actions in order to secure the passengers’
                                safety and prevent potential accidents. Safety issues are monitored via the Advanced
                                Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) and cover features like driving assistance, collision
                                protection, and emergency breaking. The evolution of ADAS technologies is expected to
                                constitute a vital factor in the autonomous driving system with major importance
                                regarding consumer acceptance.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Connectivity: </h3>
                            <p>
                                Connectivity features improve the car’s operation and are closely related with already
                                established telematics and infotainment systems within cars. In the concept of
                                autonomous driving, those features could be either provided as extra (payable) services
                                by the car’s software and/or aftermarket services, or as built-in functions purchased
                                alongside the AV model. Those services could not only include entertainment features and
                                optimal fuel consumption in the concept of the AV (already present in modern vehicles)
                                but also expand into connectivity between different AVs and outside infrastructure in
                                the concept of a synchronized autonomous car fleet.

                            <h3>Autonomous driving systems: </h3>
                            <p>
                                The development of systems that are able to automate the activity of driving is
                                essentially the core of autonomous driving. A complete autonomous driving system can be
                                described as an integration of already established systems of adaptive cruise control,
                                parking assistance, and autopilots into a unified function that uses artificial
                                intelligence (AI) and machine learning to adapt its driving behavior based on driver
                                preferences and data from the related safety and connectivity functions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The majority of these technologies are already developed and included in modern vehicles
                                but currently lack a unified interface to integrate them altogether in SAE level 5
                                automated vehicle. Currently, Tesla’s Autopilot is the only SAE level 4 autonomous
                                system in the market, with other OEMs already establishing autonomous features in their
                                models but not a related autopilot system. The majority of OEMs, including traditional
                                powerhouses such as Toyota, Volvo, BMW, Ford, and others, are already heavily engaged in
                                investing in autonomous systems in order to secure their dominant market position from
                                new, tech-heavy digital players that dynamically enter the market, such as Waymo, an
                                Alphabet (Google) subsidiary, self-driving car company.
