                                Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where
                                the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual
                                information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory,
                                haptic, somatosensory and olfactory. AR can be defined as a system that incorporates
                                three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds, real-time interaction,
                                and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects. The overlaid sensory
                                information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment), or
                                destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment). This experience is seamlessly
                                interwoven with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of
                                the real environment. In this way, augmented reality alters one's ongoing perception of
                                a real-world environment, whereas virtual reality completely replaces the user's
                                real-world environment with a simulated one. Augmented reality is related to two largely
                                synonymous terms: mixed reality and computer mediated reality.
                            </p>

                                The primary value of augmented reality is the manner in which components of the digital
                                world blend into a person's perception of the real world, not as a simple display of
                                data, but through the integration of immersive sensations, which are perceived as
                                natural parts of an environment. The earliest functional AR systems that provided
                                immersive mixed reality experiences for users were invented in the early 1990s, starting
                                with the virtual fixtures system developed at the U.S. Air Force's Armstrong labotory in
                                1992. commercial augmented reality experiences were first introduced in entertainment
                                and gaming businesses. Subsequently, augmented reality applications have spanned
                                commercial industries such as education, communications, medicine, and entertainment. In
                                education, content may be accessed by scanning or viewing an image with a mobile device
                                or by using marker less AR techniques.

                            <p>
                                Augmented reality is used to enhance natural environments or situations and offer
                                perceptually enriched experiences. With the help of advanced AR technologies (e.g.
                                adding computer vision, incorporating AR cameras into smartphone applications and object
                                recognition) the information about the surrounding real world of the user becomes
                                interactive and digitally manipulated. Information about the environment and its objects
                                is overlaid on the real world. This information can be virtual. Augmented Reality is any
                                experience which is artificial and which adds to the already existing reality. or real,
                                e.g. seeing other real sensed or measured information such as electromagnetic radio
                                waves overlaid in exact alignment with where they actually are in space. Augmented
                                reality also has a lot of potential in the gathering and sharing of tacit knowledge.
                                Augmentation techniques are typically performed in real time and in semantic contexts
                                with environmental elements. Immersive perceptual information is sometimes combined with
                                supplemental information like scores over a live video feed of a sporting event. This
                                combines the benefits of both augmented reality technology and heads up display
                                technology (HUD).

                            <h3>Comparison with virtual reality-</h3>
                            <p>
                                In virtual reality (VR), the users' perception of reality is completely based on virtual
                                information. In augmented reality (AR) the user is provided with additional computer
                                generated information within the data collected from real life that enhances their
                                perception of reality. For example, in architecture, VR can be used to create a
                                walk-through simulation of the inside of a new building; and AR can be used to show a
                                building's structures and systems super-imposed on a real-life view. Another example is
                                through the use of utility applications. Some AR applications, such as augment, enable
                                users to apply digital objects into real environments, allowing businesses to use
                                augmented reality devices as a way to preview their products in the real world.[25]
                                Similarly, it can also be used to demo what products may look like in an environment for
                                customers, as demonstrated by companies such as mountain equipment co & p or lowe”s who
                                use augmented reality to allow customers to preview what their products might look like
                                at home through the use of 3D models.

                                Augmented reality (AR) differs from virtual reality (VR) in the sense that in AR part of
                                the surrounding environment is actually 'real' and just adding layers of virtual objects
                                to the real environment. On the other hand, in VR the surrounding environment is
                                completely virtual. A demonstration of how AR layers objects onto the real world can be
                                seen with augmented reality games. wallame is an augmented reality game application that
                                allows users to hide messages in real environments, utilizing geolocation technology in
                                order to enable users to hide messages wherever they may wish in the world. Such
                                applications have many uses in the world, including in activism and artistic expression.

                                Hardware components for augmented reality are: a processor, display, sensors and input
                                devices. Modern mobile computing devices like smartphones and tablet computers contain
                                these elements, which often include a camera and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)
                                sensors such as an GPS, and solid state compass, making them suitable AR platforms.[29]
                                There are two technologies used in augmented reality: diffractive waveguides and
                                reflective waveguides.

                                A head mounted display (HMD) is a display device worn on the forehead, such as a harness
                                or helmet mounted. HMDs place images of both the physical world and virtual objects over
                                the user's field of view. Modern HMDs often employ sensors for six degrees of freedom
                                monitoring that allow the system to align virtual information to the physical world and
                                adjust accordingly with the user's head movements. HMDs can provide VR users with mobile
                                and collaborative experiences. Specific providers, such as usens and gestigon, include
                                gesture controls for full virtual immersion

                                that employs cameras to intercept the real world view and re-display its augmented view
                                through the eyepieces] and devices in which the AR imagery is projected through or
                                reflected off the surfaces of the eyewear lens pieces

                            <h3>HUD</h3>
                            <p>
                                A head-up display (HUD) is a transparent display that presents data without requiring
                                users to look away from their usual viewpoints. A precursor technology to augmented
                                reality, heads-up displays were first developed for pilots in the 1950s, projecting
                                simple flight data into their line of sight, thereby enabling them to keep their "heads
                                up" and not look down at the instruments. Near-eye augmented reality devices can be used
                                as portable head-up displays as they can show data, information, and images while the
                                user views the real world. Many definitions of augmented reality only define it as
                                overlaying the information. This is basically what a head-up display does; however,
                                practically speaking, augmented reality is expected to include registration and tracking
                                between the superimposed perceptions, sensations, information, data, and images and some
                                portion of the real world.

                            <p>
                                The eye tap (also known as Generation-2 Glass) captures rays of light that would
                                otherwise pass through the center of the lens of the wearer's eye, and substitutes
                                synthetic computer-controlled light for each ray of real light.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Generation-4 Glass (Laser EyeTap) is similar to the VRD (i.e. it uses a
                                computer-controlled laser light source) except that it also has infinite depth of focus
                                and causes the eye itself to, in effect, function as both a camera and a display by way
                                of exact alignment with the eye and resynthesis (in laser light) of rays of light
                                entering the eye.

                            <p>
                                A Handheld display employs a small display that fits in a user's hand. All handheld AR
                                solutions to date opt for video see-through. Initially handheld AR employed fiducial
                                markers and later GPS units and MEMS sensors such as digital compasses and six degrees
                                of freedom accelerometer–gyroscope. Today (SLAM) markerless trackers such as PTAM
                                (parallel tracking and mapping) are starting to come into use. Handheld display AR
                                promises to be the first commercial success for AR technologies. The two main advantages
                                of handheld AR are the portable nature of handheld devices and the ubiquitous nature of
                                camera phones. The disadvantages are the physical constraints of the user having to hold
                                the handheld device out in front of them at all times, as well as the distorting effect
                                of classically wide-angled mobile phone cameras when compared to the real world as
                                viewed through the eye.

                                Games such as pokemon go and ingress utilize an image linked app (ILM) interface, where
                                approved geotagged locations appear on a stylized map for the user to interact with.

                                Modern mobile augmented-reality systems use one or more of the following motion tracking
                                technologies: digital cameras and/or other optical sensors, accelerometers, GPS,
                                gyroscopes, solid state compasses, radio frequency radiation (RFID). These technologies
                                offer varying levels of accuracy and precision. These technologies are implemented in
                                the ARKit API by apple and ARcore API by google to allow tracking for their respective
                                mobile device platforms.

                            <p>
                                Mobile augmented reality applications are gaining popularity because of the wide
                                adoption of mobile and especially wearable devices. However, they often rely on
                                computationally intensive computer vision algorithms with extreme latency requirements.
                                To compensate for the lack of computing power, offloading data processing to a distant
                                machine is often desired. Computation offloading introduces new constraints in
                                applications, especially in terms of latency and bandwidth. Although there are a
                                plethora of real-time

                                Projectors can also be used to display AR contents. The projector can throw a virtual
                                object on a projection screen and the viewer can interact with this virtual object.
                                Projection surfaces can be many objects such as walls or glass panes.

                                The implementation of augmented reality in consumer products requires considering the
                                design of the applications and the related constraints of the technology platform. Since
                                AR systems rely heavily on the immersion of the user and the interaction between the
                                user and the system, design can facilitate the adoption of virtuality. For most
                                augmented reality systems, a similar design guideline can be followed. The following
                                lists some considerations for designing augmented reality applications:
