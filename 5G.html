                                5G networks are cellular networks, for which the service area is divided into small
                                geographical cells. The 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate over RF in the cell,
                                over frequency channels assigned by the base station. Each cell comprises of a base
                                station and remotSeveral network operators use milimeter waves called FR2 in 5G
                                terminology, for additional capacity and higher throughputs. Millimeter waves have a
                                shorter range than microhwaves, therefore the cells are limited to a smaller size.
                                Millimeter waves also have more trouble passing through building walls. Millimeter-wave
                                antennas are smaller than the large antennas used in previous cellular networks. Some
                                are only a few centimeters long.
                            </p>

                                Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) was deployed in 4G as early as 2016 and
                                typically used 32 to 128 small antennas at each cell. Multiple bitstreams of data are
                                transmitted simultaneously.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The increased speed is achieved partly by using additional higher-frequency radio waves
                                in addition to the low- and medium-band frequencies used in previous cellular networks.
                                However, higher-frequency radio waves have a shorter useful physical range, requiring
                                smaller geographic cells. For wide service, 5G networks operate on up to three frequency
                                bands – low, medium, and high.
                            </p>

                                5G can be implemented in low-band, mid-band or high-band millimeter-wave 24 GHz up to 54
                                GHz. Low-band 5G uses a similar frequency range to 4G cellphones, 600–900 MHZ, giving
                                download speeds a little higher than 4G: 30–250 megabits per seconds (Mbit/s).[4]
                                Low-band cell towers have a range and coverage area similar to 4G towers. Mid-band 5G
                                uses microwaves of 2.3–4.7 GHZ, allowing speeds of 100–900 Mbit/s, with each cell tower
                                providing service up to several kilometers in radius. This level of service is the most
                                widely deployed, and was deployed in many metropolitan areas in 2020. Some regions are
                                not implementing the low band, making Mid-band the minimum service level. High-band 5G
                                uses frequencies of 24–47 GHz, near the bottom of the millimeter wave band, although
                                higher frequencies may be used in the future. It often achieves download speeds in the
                                gigabit per second (Gbit/s) range, comparable to cable internet. However, milimeter
                                waves (mmWave or mmW) have a more limited range, requiring many small cells.[5] They can
                                be impeded or blocked by materials in walls or windows.[6] Due to their higher cost,
                                plans are to deploy these cells only in dense urban environments and areas where crowds
                                of people congregate such as sports stadiums and convention centers. The above speeds
                                are those achieved in actual tests in 2020, and speeds are expected to increase during
                                rollout.[4] The spectrum ranging from 24.25–29.5 GHz has been the most licensed and
                                deployed 5G mmWave spectrum range in the world.

                                The industry consortium setting standards for 5G is the 3rd patnership project (3GPP).
                                It defines any system using 5G NETWORK (5G New Radio) software as "5G", a definition

                                Rollout of 5G technology has led to debate over its security and relationship with
                                Chinese vendors. It has also been the subject of health concerns and misinformation,

                                The ITU-R has defined three main application areas for the enhanced capabilities of 5G.
                                They are Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications
                                (URLLC), and Massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC).] Only eMBB is deployed in 2020;
                                URLLC and mMTC are several years away in most locations.]

                                Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) uses 5G as a progression from 4G LTE ]mobile broadband
                                services, with faster connections, higher throughput, and more capacity. This will
                                benefit areas of higher traffic such as stadiums, cities, and concert venues.

                                Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) refer to using the network for mission
                                critical applications that require uninterrupted and robust data exchange. The
                                short-packet data transmission is used to meet both reliability and latency requirements
                                of the wireless communication networks.

                                Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC) would be used to connect to a large number of
                                devices. 5G technology will connect some of the 50 billion connected IoT devices.] Most
                                will use the less expensive Wi-Fi. Drones, transmitting via 4G or 5G, will aid in
                                disaster recovery efforts, providing real-time data for emergency responders. Most cars
                                will have a 4G or 5G cellular connection for many services. Autonomous cars do not
                                require 5G, as they have to be able to operate where they do not have a network
                                connection. However, most autonomous vehicles also feature teleoperations for mission
                                accomplishment, and these greatly benefit from 5G technology. While remote surgeries
                                have been performed over 5G, most remote surgery will be performed in facilities with a
                                fiber connection, usually faster and more reliable than any wireless connection.

                                mmWave bands and can reach 4 Gb/s with carrier aggregation and MIMO.

                                Sub-6 GHz 5G (mid-band 5G), by far the most common, will usually deliver between 100 and
                                4400 Mbps but will have a much further reach than mmWave, especially outdoors. C-Band
                                (n77/n78) is expected to be deployed by various operators by the end 2021.

                                The Low-band spectrum offers the greatest range, thereby a greater coverage area for a
                                given site, but its speeds are lower than the mid and high bands.

                            <h3>Latency </h3>
                            <p>
                                In 5G, the "air latency" is of the order of 8–12 milliseconds. The latency to the server
                                must be added to the "air latency" for most comparisons. Verizon reported the latency on
                                its 5G early deployment is 30 ms: Edge Servers close to the towers can reduce latency to
                                10–20 ms; 1–4 ms will be extremely rare for years outside the lab. The latency is much
                                higher during handovers; ranging from 50–500 milliseconds depending on the type of
                                handover. Reducing handover latency is an ongoing area of research and development.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Error rate</h3>
                            <p>
                                5G uses adaptive modulation and coding scheme (MCS) to keep the bit error rate extremely
                                low. Whenever the error rate crosses a (very low) threshold the transmitter will switch
                                to a lower MCS, which will be less error-prone. This way speed is sacrificed to ensure
                                an almost zero error rate.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Range </h3>
                            <p>
                                The range of 5G depends on many factors; frequency is the most important of all. mmWave
                                signals tend to have a range of only a couple of hundred meters whilst low band signals
                                generally have a range of a couple of kilometers.
                            </p>
                            <h3> </h3>
                            <p>
                                Since there is a lot of marketing hype on what 5G can offer, simulators and drive test
                                are used for the precise measurement of 5G performance.
                            </p>

                            <h3>standards</h3>
                            <p>
                                Initially, the term was associated with the international telecommunication service
                                IMT-2020 standard, which required a theoretical peak download speed of 20 gigabits per
                                second and 10 gigabits per second upload speed, along with other requirements. Then, the
                                industry standards group 3GPP chose the 5G NETWORK (New Radio) standard together with
                                LTE as their proposal for submission to the IMT-2020 standard.


                                5G NR can include lower frequencies (FR1), below 6 GHz, and higher frequencies (FR2)
                                above 24 GHz. However, the speed and latency in early FR1 deployments, using 5G NR
                                software on 4G hardware (NON-STANDALONE), are only slightly better than new 4G systems,
                                estimated at 15 to 50% better.


                                IEEE covers several areas of 5G with a core focus in wireline sections between the
                                Remote Radio Head (RRH) and Base Band Unit (BBU). The 1914.1 standards focus on network
                                architecture and dividing the connection between the RRU and BBU into two key sections.
                                Radio Unit (RU) to the Distributor Unit (DU) being the NGFI-I (Next Generation Fronthaul
                                Interface) and the DU to the Central Unit (CU) being the NGFI-II interface allowing a
                                more diverse and cost-effective network. NGFI-I and NGFI-II have defined performance
                                values which should be compiled to ensure different traffic types defined by the ITU are
                                capable of being carried. 1914.3 standard is creating a new Ethernet frame format
                                capable of carrying IQ data in a much more efficient way depending on the functional
                                split utilized. This is based on the 3GPP definition of functional splits. Multiple
                                network synchronization standards within the IEEE groups are being updated to ensure
                                network timing accuracy at the RU is maintained to a level required for the traffic
                                carried over it.
