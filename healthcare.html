                There’s no question that inventions like the stethoscope and eyeglasses were innovative for their time.
                However, medical technology has come far since then. So what are the latest healthcare technology
                innovations for 2021? Factors driving change and innovation in this industry include an aging global
                population, a more affluent middle class, and the widespread availability of the mobile internet. All
                these factors help introduce new technology that makes the medical industry better in every way
                imaginable. Unfortunately, due to all this growth and change, it is estimated that over 50% of the
                medical industry workforce will require at least minimum reskilling down the road. If you are interested
                in learning more about all these new technologies, keep reading. Below you can learn about some of the
                most innovative and impressive techs for 2021.
              </p>
              <h2>Telemedicine-</h2>
              <p>
                In 2020 COVID-19 significantly accelerated the prevalence and use of different telehealth resources. In
                fact, in April 2020, over 43% of all Medicare primary care visits involved telehealth rather than
                in-office appointments. A huge benefit of telehealth over in-person appointments is that it reduces
                contact between healthcare workers and patients. In addition, a factor that has helped ensure telehealth
                services are accurate is wearable devices, which allow healthcare workers to gather real-time
                information related to patient data, even if they were not in the office. Something else worth noting is
                that telehealth’s growth and use are likely going to continue after the pandemic is over. In fact, about
                71% of all patients in the U.S. considered (or did) use telemedicine when the pandemic began, with 50%
                having already used some virtual appointment. Since telehealth was already growing the year before, the
                pandemic provided a significant boost for the development of the industry. By 2026, it’s expected
                telehealth will break the $185 billion mark. One of the most important aspects of the success of the
                telehealth industry is patient adoption. Because more and more patients are becoming comfortable with
                telehealth, it is obvious the industry has a promising future.

              <h3>Can we choose gaming as our profession? </h3>
              <p>
                Of course, gaming is the kind of profession nowadays. There are different categories found and based on
                the field we choose they will earn money. They are, People work in the game station, and they will help

              </p>
              <h3>Permanent Changes to Cleaning Tech and Hospital Design</h3>
              <p>
                Another trend that COVID-19 brought about is the cleaning aspect of hospitals and other healthcare
                facilities. To help keep these spaces sanitary, providers are investigating many new tools to enforce
                good hygiene and handle deep cleaning. The layout and check-in process for hospitals is also being
                changed to help reduce patient “clustering” and identify any contagious individuals before they even
                come into the building. Some of the latest tech options that are helping with this include autonomous
                robots and RFID technology. The robots are equipped with a unique germ-killing UV light. When used, the
                light can decontaminate any space or room in around 15 to 20 minutes (depending on size). With RFID
                technology, it is possible to track how often and how long employees wash their hands. Some hospitals
                and medical offices also install thermal cameras at entry doors to determine if someone has an elevated
                body temperature before entering the building. The cameras will measure an individual’s body
                temperature, ensuring no one has an elevated temperature before entering. While this is not a universal
                symptom of COVID-19, it is one of the most common. It is also predicted there will be more design
                changes to buildings and that these changes will seep into other commercial spaces, too. So, for
                example, next time you visit a health food store for your protein powder, you may be scanned for an
                elevated body temperature.Some of the design changes being made include convertible areas to help
                accommodate any surge in critical care patients and transparent plastic or glass walls to view patients
                in isolation. Some medical facilities are also retrofitting rooms to deliver inpatient telehealth and
                various tools, like handheld buzzers and touch screen kiosks, to help ensure waiting areas don’t get
                overcrowded
              </p>
              <h>New Methods for Drug Development</h>
              <p>
                The development of several COVID-19 vaccines in under a year will likely be remembered as a huge
                scientific accomplishment in human history. The entire process for approval was sped up thanks to
                regulatory fast-tracking and innovations in how medical trials were set up and conducted. In this case,
                virtual clinical trials, which were primarily online, helped ease the burden and complexity of
                participating. This, combined with a feeling of collaboration instead of competition between the top
                pharmaceutical companies, helped pave the way to a much brighter future drug development.It is predicted
                that some of the more relaxed regulatory procedures related to drug development will fade as the
                COVID-19 pandemic ends. Still, the more innovative approaches to collaboration and testing will remain.
                For example, the alliance between the pharmaceutical industry’s big names has helped to collaboratively
                explore all new antiviral treatments and share new and preliminary data. Today, the FDA has released
                all-new guidelines for virtual trials, which has opened up an all-new frontier to develop and test
                all-new drugs.
              </p>
              <h>Gene Therapy for Hemoglobinopathies- </h>
              <p>
                The hemoglobin molecule is a red protein that is responsible for transporting oxygen in your blood.
                Hemoglobinopathies are a type of genetic disorder that impacts the production or structure of your
                hemoglobin molecule. Some of the most common hemoglobinopathies include thalassemia and sickle cell
                disease, which, combined, impact over 330K children in the world each year. Currently, more than 100K
                patients are dealing with sickle cell disease in the U.S. New research has derived gene therapy, which
                is providing individuals with hemoglobinopathies to create functional hemoglobin molecules. This also
                helps to reduce the presence of ineffective red blood cells and sickled blood cells. It is also helping
                to prevent complications that are also commonly seen with this condition.
              </p>
              <h>Implementing AI for Efficiency and Automation-</h>
              <p>
                With doctors, nurses, and other support staff rushing to handle the waves of coronavirus patients, all
                while dealing with reduced staff because of mandated isolation or the illness, they searched for options
                to help take on some of the work or anticipate the developing needs before they occurred.The need for
                touch-free interactions and efficiency will help improve natural language processing in the clinical
                field. This is a part of AI that makes it possible for computers to understand spoken words. Once
                recorded, the information is transmitted into the patient record. Another efficiency touched on above is
                automated services, like robots and chatbots, that can help alleviate the all-too-common bottlenecks in
                the administration area. Higher levels and AI adoption will continue to grow and evolve to help deliver
                a higher level of personalized care. This includes machine learning and algorithms that will accurately
                detect heart disease and cancer, along with virtual assistants that can deliver reminders for medication
                and even robot-led therapy for patients recovering from a stroke.
              </p>
              <h2>The IoMT – Internet of Medical Things-</h2>
              <p>
                Several mobile apps and devices have come into existence to help track and prevent chronic illnesses.
                The combination of IoT development with telehealth and telemedicine technologies has created a new IoMT
                – the Internet of Medical Things.With this, several wearables have been used, including EKG and ECG
                monitors. It is also possible to take other common medical measurements, including blood pressure
                readings, glucose levels, and skin temperature.It’s estimated that by the year 2025, the IoT industry
                will exceed $6.2 trillion. Today, the healthcare industry has become so reliant on IoT tech in 2020 that
                up to 30% of the total market share for all IoT devices will come from the healthcare industry.As new
                delivery methods are presented, like the first FDA-approved smart pill in 2017, more interesting options
                for providing care are being given to healthcare practitioners.It is important to note that providing
                effective and consistent communication with several IoT devices is one of this sector’s main challenges.
                Many manufacturers are still using their own protocols for “talking” to the developed devices, which can
                cause issues, especially when working to acquire larger amounts of data by the servers.Another issue is
                connectivity. Collecting data via smartphones and microcontrollers may be disrupted by several
                environmental factors. The buffering methods for local microcontrollers must become much more robust to
                keep quality connections. Some security concerns must be dealt with. In fact, one study indicated that
                up to 89% of all healthcare operations underwent a minimum of a data breach.
