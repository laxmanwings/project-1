                            <h2>Five ways to get rid of space debris </h2>
                            <p>
                                Space debris or space junk or orbital debris is used to refer to those objects that are
                                present in orbit around Earth. These useless materials can be anything from spent rocket
                                stages, defunct satellites to substances which come out of rockets and satellites due to
                                explosion and collision. The debris can prove dangerous for spacecrafts because they
                                often block the trajectories of newer objects. Here below are the five ways to get rid
                                of space debris.

                            </p>
                            <h3>1. DARPA invests in giant space nets to catch trash- </h3>
                            <p>
                                The President of Star Inc, Jerome Pearson, has come up with an idea called “a space
                                garbage truck”, which can be used to remove space debris. He presented the idea during
                                the 2010 Space Elevator conference. Pearson proposed that EDDE vehicle equipped around
                                200 butterflies like nets can be used to collect debris from the low-earth orbit. He
                                suggested that in around 7 years, 12 EDDE vehicles would be able to clean the LEO by
                                capturing all 2,465 identified objects. He said that the vehicle can be used to remove
                                debris weighing more than 2 kilograms. After capturing the debris, the EDDE can throw
                                the garbage directly into South Pacific. It can also deliver the debris captured from
                                the LEO near the Earth where it will not block the trajectories of other spacecrafts and
                                will decay with the passage of time.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Connectivity: </h3>
                            <p>
                                Connectivity features improve the car’s operation and are closely related with already
                                established telematics and infotainment systems within cars. In the concept of
                                autonomous driving, those features could be either provided as extra (payable) services
                                by the car’s software and/or aftermarket services, or as built-in functions purchased
                                alongside the AV model. Those services could not only include entertainment features and
                                optimal fuel consumption in the concept of the AV (already present in modern vehicles)
                                but also expand into connectivity between different AVs and outside infrastructure in
                                the concept of a synchronized autonomous car fleet.


                            </p>
                            <h3>2. Cleaning up space junk by adding dust </h3>
                            <p>
                                - According to Garudas Ganguli of the Naval Research Laboratory, the space junk can be
                                reduced by sending small pieces of dust into orbit. He said that the dust needs to
                                collide with the debris and that’s why it should be sent in the opposite direction to
                                the debris. When the dust will collide with the debris, it will bounce of it or vaporize
                                it. This will cause the debris to lose energy, making it to fall to a lower orbit. The
                                dust will also come down due to lower orbit because of the drag that will feel due to
                                its small size. The fall of debris and dust will make free space in that orbit. The dust
                                and debris will eventually arrive in the lower orbit and here they will not cause any
                                problem because the satellites do not use the lower orbit.
                            </p>
                            <h3>3. Ground-based laser cannon to turn space debris into self-powered flaming de-orbiting
                                rockets-</h3>
                            <p>
                                In this technique, we can use a powerful laser cannon, which is ground-based, to remove
                                space debris present in the low earth orbit. The laser pulses fired from the
                                ground-based cannon would lead to the emanation of small plasma jet emanating the debris
                                present in the orbit and the debris will start turning into own laser-powered rocket and
                                would eventually would remove itself from orbit. This technique was put forward in 2011.
                                The authors of the paper claim that a 33-foot telescope can be used a laser cannon. The
                                authors noted that the debris should be targeted carefully so that they land in the
                                Pacific Ocean and do not cause any damage on earth.
                            </p>
                            <h3>4. Russia investing $2 billion in space debris removal</h3>
                            <p>
                                - Russian space corporation Energia is planning to invest $2 billion in order to remove
                                space debris. The plan is to build a “pod” that will be used to remove the garbage
                                present in lower orbit of the earth. The pod will be able to run for around 15 years
                                using a nuclear power core and it will use it time in space to remove defunct satellites
                                out of orbit so that they can either land in oceans or burn in the space itself. It is
                                expected that the construction of this pod will get over by 2020 and it will start its
                                mission by 2023. Russian scientists are hopeful that this especially designed pod would
                                be able to remove around 600 defunct satellites in 10 years.
                            </p>
                            <h3>5. Orbital debris removal satellite: Clean-ME</h3>
                            <p>
                                Center EPFL is set to design a nanosatellite with dimensions of 30 x 30 x 30 cm, which
                                will be used to remove space debris from the lower orbit of the earth. This
                                nanosatellite will use advanced technologies in order to complete its task successfully.
                                The project is aptly named Clean Me project.
