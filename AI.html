                            <p>
                                The entire tech world is debating the consequences of artificial intelligence and the
                                part AI is going to play in shaping our future. While we might think that artificial
                                intelligence is at least a few years away from causing any considerable effects on our
                                lives, the fact remains that it is already having an enormous impact on us. Artificial
                                intelligence is affecting our decisions and our lifestyles every day. Don’t believe me?
                                Well, read along as we tell you 22 examples of artificial intelligence you are using in
                                your daily life.
                            </p>
                            <h2>1. Google Search- </h2>
                            <p>
                                The most fundamental activity on the internet is searching for things. And for the last
                                decade and more, Google Search has been the go-to search engine to look for all sorts of
                                stuff. So what makes Google Search such a powerful and accurate directory of the whole
                                web? You guessed it right, it’s AI that is working behind the scenes. Whenever you are
                                searching for things online, you are effectively using AI in the true sense. In the last
                                3-4 years, Google introduced some of the AI elements to improve the ranking of websites.
                                Now, it uses AI on Google Search for recommending a specific part of the video based on
                                your search query, readily suggests questions and answers that you might be interested
                                in and smart search suggestions below the search result. It’s only because of AI that
                                you rarely have to move to the 2nd page on Google Search. So if you were wondering about
                                where do you interact with AI in daily life, well it’s Google Search.
                            </p>
                            <h3>2. Google Duplex and Hold For Me</h3>
                            <p>
                                Google duplex is another AI-based service that is truly leveraging the full potential of
                                AI. In 2018, Google demonstrated Duplex which could book a table at restaurants on your
                                behalf. It mimics human voice and understands context and replies naturally just like
                                any other human being. You can use Google Duplex to book a movie ticket at a theater,
                                book a seat at a salon, and more. Currently, the service is only limited to the US and
                                is available only in English. Note that, now the service is available on iPhones with
                                the Google Assistant app and on flagship Samsung and Pixel phones. Apart from that, hold
                                for me is a new addition to Pixel phones in the US. It’s another example of AI in our
                                daily life that makes day-to-day tasks so much hassle-free. For example, if you call a
                                toll-free number and when you are put on hold, Google Assistant can handle the call and
                                notify you when an actual human is ready to talk to you. This way, you can save a lot of
                                time.
                            </p>
                            <h3>3. Smart Compose, Quick Reply, and Grammar Check- </h3>
                            <p>
                                If you use Gmail then you might have noticed a new feature called smart compose. It
                                suggests complete sentences based on the preceding line that you have written. It uses
                                Artificial Intelligence to quickly compose your email drafts with contextual accuracy
                                and correct grammar. I use it quite often and believe me, it’s pretty helpful. There
                                could be no better example of AI making life better and saving time on the other hand.
                                You can use this feature in the Compose window. Whenever you get a smart compose
                                suggestion, just hit the tab key and it will be added to your draft. There is also quick
                                reply, both in Gmail and messaging apps on Android, and this technology is also powered
                                by AI. For example, when I get a message on WhatsApp, some quick replies appear on top
                                of the notification based on the message. You can simply tap on it and the reply will be
                                sent instantly. This is another example of AI making a small difference in how we
                                interact online. Lastly, we have Grammar Check on Google Docs which is powered by AI.
                                There are countless people who use Google Docs to write stories, articles, and whatnot.
                                And Google leverages its advancement in AI to help users write error-free sentences. The
                                service is enabled by default, but you can manually turn it on from Tools -> Spelling
                                and Grammar. Apart from Google’s service, you have Grammarly and many alternatives that
                                offer AI-based grammar checks.
                            </p>
                            <h3>4. Google Recorder, Live Captions, and Transcribe- </h3>
                            <p>
                                One of the best uses of AI is happening in speech detection. Google recorder, otter.ai
                                are some of the best examples which are leveraging AI to transcribe speeches in
                                real-time. In fact, Google Recorder goes one step further and uses Machine Learning
                                (which is a subset of AI) to transcribe speeches without internet connectivity.
                                Everything happens offline and with pinpoint accuracy. Not to mention, it also creates a
                                searchable note so you can easily edit the transcription on the go.Besides that, Google
                                has also brought live caption on Android and Chrome browser. It can listen to internal
                                audio and offer live caption in real-time. All of this is possible because of AI. Note
                                that, currently, Live Captions only supports English. Then there is the Live Transcribe
                                app by Google which transcribes speeches in over 80 languages and in real-time. That’s
                                absolutely great, right? Not to mention, it can detect surrounding sounds such as fire
                                alarm or doorbell ringing which can help people who are deaf and hard of hearing.
                            </p>
                            <h3>5. Google Lens and OCR- </h3>
                            <p>
                                Google Lens is another Google service that is built on AI and has some great technology
                                for fast and accurate optical recognition. It allows you to search for anything through
                                images. Just point the camera to a shoe or a plant or an animal or a text, it can detect
                                the type of subject and will provide precise information on that thing in just a few
                                seconds. All of this is possible because of AI’s advancement in the field of optical
                                recognition. Not to mention, Google Lens can also do OCR now and you can extract texts
                                from images easily. In fact, almost all the OCR software libraries like Tesseract or
                                TensorFlow are built on AI to detect the characters on an image. When you use apps like
                                Adobe Scan or Microsoft Office Lens, smart cropping and edge detection are actually
                                powered by AI. So nonchalantly, you are actively using AI in your daily life and
                                benefitting from it.
                            </p>
                            <h3>6. Image Editing </h3>
                            <p>
                                Remove Background & Enhance Resolution- AI is also being extensively used in image
                                editing. remove.bg (visit) is one of the popular websites to remove the background of an
                                image through AI. What used to take minutes through the Lasso tool can now be down
                                algorithmically in just a few second.Next, you have the “Enhance” tool that has finally
                                arrived on professional image editing programs. Image editors can now literally enhance
                                an image with the click of a button. Adobe recently introduced the Super Resolution
                                feature that enhances the pixel by a factor of four, effectively improving detail,
                                sharpness, and resolution of the image. It uses Machine Learning to interpolate adjacent
                                pixels and reduce artifacts

                            <p>
                                Newer Apple Watches come with a Fall Detection feature that alerts the nearby emergency
                                team when it senses you had a hard fall. It uses data from the accelerometer and
                                gyroscope to sense the fall and leverages AI algorithms to accurately sense a hard fall.
                                You may not know it, but due to AI, so many lives are being saved.Similarly, Google
                                Pixel phones now come with car rash detection which is trained on Machine Learning
                                models of real-life car crashes. If the phone senses a car crash, it sends the location
                                to your chosen contacts and also sends an alert to the response team. It’s safe to say
                                that from software utilities to life-saving features, all of them are now powered by AI
                                that we use in our daily life.

                            <p>
                                - If you are using a smartphone, you are interacting with AI whether you know it or not.
                                From the obvious AI features such as the built-in smart assistants to not-so-obvious
                                ones such as the portrait mode in the camera, AI is impacting our lives every day. In
                                fact, the two examples that I provided above give us a glimpse into the world of AI and
                                how it is affecting our lives. Firstly, there are the obvious AI elements that most of
                                us have some knowledge about. For example, when you are using a smart assistant, whether
                                it’s google assistant, alexa, Siri, or Bixby, you more or less know that these
                                assistants are based on AI. However, when we are using a feature such as the portrait
                                mode while shooting a picture, we never consider that AI might be behind that too. Have
                                you ever thought about how the Google Pixel phones or iPhones can capture such great
                                portrait shots? The answer is artificial intelligence.Now more and more manufacturers
                                are including AI in their smartphones with big chip manufacturers including Qualcomm and
                                Huawei producing chips with built-in AI capabilities. The AI integration is helping in
                                bringing features like scene detection, mixed and virtual reality elements, and more. AI
                                is going to play an even major role in the coming years. We are already seeing a huge
                                emphasis on AI with the latest Android and iOS updates.
                            </p>
                            <h3>9. Smart Cars and Drones </h3>
                            <p>
                                Talking about AI, there is no better and more prominent display of this technology than
                                what smart car and drone manufacturers are doing with it. Just a few years back, using a
                                fully automatic car was a dream, however, now companies like Tesla have made so much
                                progress that we already have a fleet of semi-automatic cars on the road. Companies like
                                Amazon and Walmart are heavily investing in delivery programs and it will become a
                                reality far sooner than what you expect. If you think that’s far-fetched, do note that
                                militaries all over the world are already using successful drone programs.Tesla cars are
                                a prime example of how AI is impacting our daily life. Did you know that all the Tesla
                                cars are connected and the things that your car learns are shared across all the cars?
                                That means, if you had to take an unanticipated hard-left on a cross-road, all the Tesla
                                cars will know how to manage that turn after they are updated. There are already more
                                than 500,000 Tesla cars running in the US alone and that number is set to increase
                                exponentially now that Tesla has solved its major production problems. With autonomous
                                cars running on our roads and autonomous drones flying above us, you won’t be able to
                                deny the impact of AI on our lives.
                            </p>
                            <h3>10. Social Media Feeds, Amazon, and Netflix Recommendations </h3>
                            <p>
                                - If you are thinking that smart cars don’t personally affect you as they are still not
                                in your country or city, well, how about something which you use on a daily basis. Even
                                if you are living under a rock, there’s a high probability that you are tweeting from
                                underneath it. If Twitter’s not your choice of poison, maybe it’s Facebook or Instagram,
                                or Snapchat or any of the myriad of social media apps out there. Well, if you are using
                                social media, most of your decisions are being impacted by artificial intelligence. From
                                the feeds that you see in your timeline to the notifications that you receive from these
                                apps, everything is curated by AI. AI takes all your past behavior, web searches,
                                interactions, and everything else that you do when you are on these websites and tailors
                                the experience just for you. The sole purpose of AI here is to make the apps so
                                addictive that you come back to them again and again, and I am ready to place a bet that
                                AI is winning this war against you.Not to mention, the recommendations you see on Amazon
                                after adding a product to the cart or based on your browsing history, all of them are
                                curated based on AI. Even the Netflix recommendations are smartly curated using AI to
                                show you movies and shows that are tuned to your preferences.
                            </p>
                            <h3>11. Music and Media Streaming Services </h3>
                            <p>
                                Another great example of how AI impacts our lives are the music and media streaming
                                services like netflix that we are using on a daily basis. Whether you are using Spotify
                                or YouTube, AI is making the decisions for you. You might feel that you are in total
                                control but you are not. And as it is with everything, sometimes it’s good and sometimes
                                it is bad. For example, I love the Discover Weekly playlist on Spotify as it has
                                introduced me to several new artists which I wouldn’t have been introduced to if not for
                                the AI gods at Spotify.On the other hand, I also remember going down the YouTube rabbit
                                hole wasting countless hours just watching the recommended videos. That recommended
                                videos section has become so good at knowing my taste that it’s scary. So, next time you
                                are hitting play on a recommended video on YouTube or watching arecommended show on
                                Netflix, or listening to a pre-created playlist on Spotify, or any other media and music
                                streaming service for that matter, remember that AI is playing a big role in that.

                            <h3>12. Video Games- </h3>
                            <p>
                                The video game industry is probably one of the earliest adopters of AI. The integration
                                started very small with the use of AI to generate random levels that people can play.
                                However, that has increased to a level that goes far beyond what one can even imagine.On
                                the large scale, we just observed OpenAI 5, developed by the company OpenAI which is
                                being backed by Elon Musk, beating pro-level Dota 2 players in one on one matches while
                                also beating amateur Dota 2 teams. This achievement is being hailed as a leapfrogging
                                moment in the AI industry. Dota 2 is a strategy-based game where players have to make
                                decisions every second, and beating pro players in such a dynamic game is a huge
                                achievement for AI.Keeping the Dota 2 win aside for a while, let’s talk about how AI is
                                infiltrating our normal gaming industry. Any game that you play has some sort of AI
                                element to it. When you are playing a game such as PUBG or Fortnite, you essentially
                                start against a couple of AI-powered bots and then move to play against real players.
                                Even when you are playing a single-person story mode game, you are playing against AI
                                bosses.If you are playing racing games, you are racing against AI bots. Probably the
                                most interesting use of AI we have seen in games is in the Middle Earth series of games
                                where your enemies which are controlled by AI evolve based on their interaction with you
                                and other gaming elements. I can go on and on about the use of AI in games, but that
                                would make this article very long. Just know that if you play any game, you are using
                                AI.

                            <p>
                                One of the biggest users of artificial intelligence is the online ad industry which uses
                                AI to not only track user statistics but also to serve us ads based on those statistics.
                                Without AI, the online ad industry will just fail as it would show random ads to users
                                with no connection to their preferences whatsoever. AI has become so successful in
                                determining our interests and serving us ads that the global digital ad industry has
                                crossed 250 billion US dollars with the industry projected to cross the 300 billion mark
                                in 2019. So next time when you are going online and seeing ads or product
                                recommendations, know that AI is impacting your life.
                            </p>
                            <h3>14. Navigation and Travel- </h3>
                            <p>
                                By now you must be convinced of the fact that AI is impacting our lives on a daily
                                basis. However, if there are still some skeptics out there let us take a few more
                                examples. How about the navigation and travel industry? I mean, most of us travel from
                                time to time and use the navigation on almost a daily basis. Do you know that whether
                                you are using Google or Apple Maps for navigating, or calling an Uber, or booking a
                                flight ticket, you are using AI? Well, if you didn’t know that before, it’s time that
                                you open your eyes. Both Google and Apple along with other navigation services use
                                artificial intelligence to interpret hundreds of thousands of data points that they
                                receive to give you real-time traffic data. When you are calling an Uber, both the
                                pricing and the car that matches your ride request is decided by AI. As you can see, AI
                                plays a significant role in how we reach from point A to point B.
                            </p>
                            <h3>15. Banking and Finance- </h3>
                            <p>
                                The banking and finance industry plays a major role in our lives. I mean the world runs
                                on money and banks are essentially the gatekeepers that regulate that flow. Did you know
                                that the banking and finance industry heavily relies on artificial intelligence for
                                things like customer service, fraud protection, investment, and more? A simple example
                                is the automated emails that you receive from banks whenever you do an
                                out-of-the-ordinary transaction. Well, that’s AI watching over your account and trying
                                to warn you of any fraud.AI is also being trained to look at large samples of fraud data
                                and find a pattern so that you can be warned before it happens to you. Also, when you
                                hitch a little snag and chat with the bank’s customer service, chances are that you are
                                chatting with an AI bot. Even the big players in the finance industry use AI to analyze
                                data to find the best avenues to invest money so they can get the most returns with the
                                least risk. That’s not all, AI is poised to play an even bigger role in the industry as
                                major banks across the world are investing billions of dollars in AI technology and we
                                all will observe its effects sooner than later.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We are even willingly letting artificial intelligence in our houses. Many of the smart
                                home devices that we buy use artificial intelligence to learn our behavior so that they
                                can adjust the settings themselves to make the experience as frictionless as possible
                                for us. We have already talked about smart voice assistants which we use to control
                                these smart home devices, and as we know, they are the prime example of AI impacting our
                                lives.I will agree that a perfect AI-powered house that reacts to our choices in real
                                lives is still a decade or so away, however, we are seeing the steps that will take us
                                there. I mean, there are smart thermostats that adjust the temperature based on your
                                preferences, smart lights that change the color and intensity of lights based on time,
                                and much more. It won’t be long when our main interactions with all our smart home
                                devices will be through AI only.

                            <p>
                                While we can all debate the ethics of using a broad surveillance system, there’s no
                                denying the fact that it is being used and AI is playing a big part in that. It is not
                                possible for humans to keep monitoring multiple monitors with feeds from hundreds if not
                                thousands of cameras at the same time, and hence, using AI makes perfect sense. With
                                technologies like object recognition and facial recognition getting better and better
                                every day, it won’t be long when all the security camera feeds are being monitored by an
                                AI and not a human. While there’s still time before AI can be fully implemented, this is
                                going to be our future.

                            <p>
                                Granted, not everyone loves dealing with on-screen keyboards. However, they have become
                                far more intuitive, allowing users to type comfortably and faster. What has probably
                                proved to be a catalyst for them is the integration of AI. The smart keyboard apps keep
                                a tab on the writing style of a user and predict words and emojis accordingly. Thus,
                                typing on touchscreen become faster and more convenient. Not to mention, artificial
                                intelligence also plays a vital role in pinpointing misspellings and types.

                            <p>
                                Not for nothing, many believe that smart speakers are all set for a big boom in
                                technology. Aside from controlling smart home devices, they are also up to the task for
                                several things like sending quick messages, setting reminders, checking the weather and
                                getting the latest news. And it’s this versatility that’s proving to be a decisive
                                factor for them.Led by the hugely popular Amazon Echo series, the global smart speaker
                                market reached an unprecedented high in 2019 with sales of 149.9 million units, which is
                                a significant increase of 70% in 2018. Moreover, the sales in Q4 2019 also saw a new
                                record with a whopping 55.7 million units. Smart speakers are probably the most overt
                                examples of use of AI in our real life.

                                The use of artificial intelligence has given a new dimension to healthcare. With the
                                introduction of AI-powered machines, it’s become a bit easier to detect disease and
                                diagnosis. Moreover, it’s also playing a significant role in making the treatment and
                                management processes more simplified. As a result, hospitals and healthcare centers are
                                fast embracing AI-enabled technologies to facilitate everything from research to the
                                detection of diseases.
