                                Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely
                                different from the real world. Applications of virtual reality include entertainment
                                (particularly video games), education (such as medical or military training) and
                                business (such as virtual meetings). Other distinct types of VR-style technology include
                                augmented reality and mixed reality, sometimes referred to as extended reality or XR.
                            </p>
                            <h2></h2>
                            <p>
                                Currently, standard virtual reality systems use either virtual reality headsets or
                                multi-projected environments to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations
                                that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment. A person using
                                virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move around in
                                it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR
                                headsets consisting of a head mounted display with a small screen in front of the eyes,
                                but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens.
                                Virtual reality typically incorporates auditory and video feedback, but may also allow
                                other types of sensory and force feedback through haptic technology.

                            <p>
                                “virtual” has had the meaning of "being something in essence or effect, though not
                                actually or in fact" since the mid-1400s. The term "virtual" has been used in the
                                computer sense of "not physically existing but made to appear by software " since 1959.

                                In 1938, French avant-garde playwright Antonin Artaud described the illusory nature of
                                characters and objects in the theatre as “la realite virtuelle” in a collection of
                                essays, Le Théâtre et son double. The English translation of this book, published in
                                1958 as the theatre and its double, is the earliest published use of the term "virtual
                                reality". The term "artificial reality", coined by Myron Krueger, has been in use since
                                the 1970s. The term "virtual reality" was first used in a science fiction context in The
                                Judas Mandala, a 1982 novel by Damien Broderick.
                            </p>

                                Widespread adaption of the term "virtual reality" in the popular media is attributed to
                                jaron lanier, who in the late 1980s designed some of the first business-grade virtual
                                reality hardware under his firm VPL Research, and the 1992 film lawnmower man, which
                                features use of virtual reality systems.

                                One method by which virtual reality can be realized is simulation -based virtual
                                reality. Driving simulators, for example, give the driver on board the impression of
                                actually driving an actual vehicle by predicting vehicular motion caused by driver input
                                and feeding back corresponding visual, motion and audio cues to the driver.
                            </p>

                                With avatar image -based virtual reality, people can join the virtual environment in the
                                form of real video as well as an avatar. One can participate in the 3D distributed
                                virtual environment as form of either a conventional avatar or a real video. Users can
                                select their own type of participation based on the system capability.

                                Mixed reality (MR) is the merging of the real world and virtual worlds to produce new
                                environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact
                                in real time.
                                A cyber space is sometimes defined as a networked virtual reality.
                                Simulated reality is a hypothetical virtual reality as truly immersive as the actual
                                reality, enabling an advanced life like experience or even virtual eternity.
